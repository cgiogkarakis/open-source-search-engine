// . in this way we only allow one host per redundancy group to write to
//   disk at any one time, so the other(s) are available to perform quick
//   disk reads for queries or spider requests
// . the first host of each group is always the permanent token manager
// . if he goes down then you just have to wait for him to come back up
//   before you can get the token
// . if any host in the group goes down, then the manager will not pass
//   the token until that host comes back up
// . clients periodically sync with the manager host to make sure they
//   have the same callback token-request info (sync about every 30 secs).
//   that way, should anyone go down, the sync() will fix things

// each client creates one of these Wait classes for every disk dump or merge
// that needs to be done
