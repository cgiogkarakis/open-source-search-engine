/* When adding links/urls to spiderdb, Msg10.cpp, should lookup their IP
address if not already provided using a new Msg class. This is done by MsgC.
Msg class consults the local cache (g_dnsLocal) in Dns.cpp for the IP
address first, if not found it should then consult S_localDnsCache. If it 
is not found there, then send the dns lookup request to a host in
the cluster based on the hash of the hostname DIV'd with the number of hosts in
the cluster, g_hostdb.m_numHosts. The request should be looked up in 
g_dnsDistributed, not Dns.cpp's local cache, and delivered to
the responsible host. If not there, then the request should be sent to the
appropriate dns server. It is like an L1a/L1b/L2/L3 architecture, where L1 
is local, L2 is on a host in the network and L3 is on the dns server. The
returned result (the IP address) should be stored in all 4 caches.*/
